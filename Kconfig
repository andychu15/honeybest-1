config SECURITY_HASHLOCK
	tristate "Hash lock to parent process"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  Any files read through the kernel file reading interface
	  (kernel modules, firmware, kexec images, security policy)
	  can be pinned to the first filesystem used for loading. When
	  enabled, any files that come from other filesystems will be
	  rejected. This is best used on systems without an initrd that
	  have a root filesystem backed by a read-only device such as
	  dm-verity or a CDROM.

config SECURITY_HASHLOCK_ENABLED
	bool "Enforce HashLock at boot"
	depends on SECURITY_HASHLOCK
	help
	  If selected, HashLock will enforce pinning at boot. If not
	  selected, it can be enabled at boot with the kernel parameter
	  "hashlock.enabled=1".
